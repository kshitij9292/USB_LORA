USB Arduino LoRa Dongle

This project is a USB-based LoRa dongle built using an Arduino-compatible microcontroller and a LoRa module. It allows for long-range wireless communication via LoRaWAN or point-to-point (P2P) LoRa networks, making it ideal for IoT applications, sensor data transmission, and remote monitoring.
Features

    Plug-and-Play USB Interface – Easily connect to a computer or embedded system
    LoRa Communication – Supports LoRaWAN and P2P modes
    Arduino-Compatible – Program using the Arduino IDE
    Serial Interface – Communicate via UART over USB
    Low Power Consumption – Optimized for IoT applications

Hardware Components

    Arduino-compatible microcontroller (e.g., ATmega32U4, ESP32, or STM32)
    LoRa module (e.g., SX1276, RFM95)
    USB-to-serial converter (if required)
    PCB design for compact form factor

Software

    Arduino firmware with LoRa communication libraries
    USB serial communication for data transmission
    Example sketches for sending and receiving LoRa packets
